An improved manual for the game [Keep Talking and Nobody
Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/), meant to be quicker and easier for
the Expert to read than the normal manual.

This is still a work in progress, and does not yet include all modules.

This manual distills the original manual's prose into concise lookup tables.
In some cases, it also modifies the instructions given, in a way that preserves
behavior but simplifies the lookups.  For example, for the Button module, the
original rule 5 ("If the button is yellow, hold the button...") is redundant
(because rule 6 only applies to red buttons, and rule 7 is a catch-all that has
the same effect as rule 5), and can therefore be removed.  Similarly, the other
Button rules can be partially reordered so as to put all the button label
special-cases together, allowing the Expert to quickly skip past them when they
don't apply.

This manual also provides specific strategies for certain modules to quicken
communcation between the Expert and the Defuser.  For example, on the Knob
module, rather than reading off all twelve lights, the Defuser reads just four
specific lights (the fourth and fifth light in each row) that are sufficient to
determine the correct knob direction, and the relevant lookup table in this
manual references only those four lights.

Note that in distilling the original manual down to a more concise form, this
manual leaves out most of the high-level instructions for each module.
Therefore this manual is only intended for experienced players who already know
how each module works.
